# DungeonShopWebappPublic
The contained project is an application I created using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and PHP as a database manager for a WIP video game project titled "Dungeon Shop." It was originally created for internal use during game development.
The following files/folders are my own original work:
* The API directory
* The files contained in js/app
* index.php
* setup.php
* The files contained in the tabcontent directory
* css/style.css
css/main.css is a base file built through a combination of https://html5boilerplate.com/, the work of fellow Cornell student https://github.com/simeon, and myself.
